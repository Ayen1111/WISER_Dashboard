##  Project Overview

WISER is an end-to-end AI solution designed to help logistics companies:

 1) Predict delayed deliveries before they happen  
 2) Identify best carrier for each lane & priority  
 3) Reduce logistics cost, COâ‚‚ emissions & SLA penalties  
 4) Provide real-time insights into supply chain performance  

This dashboard supports Data-Driven **Predict â†’ Rebalance â†’ Save Cost & COâ‚‚** decisions.

##  Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|  Data Visualization | Performance by carrier, cost vs distance trends |
|  SLA Risk Prediction | ML model predicts delivery delays using Random Forest |
|  Smart Carrier Recommendation | Suggests carrier switch to improve on-time %
|  Sustainability Tracking | Calculates COâ‚‚ footprint per order using distance |
|  Multi-dataset Support | Works with sample or real enterprise data |
|  Auto Data Mapping | Column-name independent processing |

##  Machine Learning

 Classification model for **SLA Breach (Delay vs No Delay)**  
 Regression model for **expected delay hours**

**Metrics (sample dataset):**  
- Accuracy: 100% *(limited sample â€” expected lower on real data)*  
- Zero False Negatives â†’ No delayed order missed

 Shows business-first ML capability
